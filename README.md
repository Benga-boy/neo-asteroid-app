# Task -
1. Display a list of asteroids with fields of your choice. (10 items) - using *Neo - Browse*
2. Use the *Neo - Feed* api endpoint for creating a date component which takes start date and end date from the user. On selecting the dates you need to display a list of asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth. (10 items in the list as per their closest approach)
3. Create a mechanism for searching a specific asteroid based on its ID.
4. Add user login/sign up and allow a user to save their favourite asteroids to their account


## Day one

* Tested out all the api endpoints in Insomnia to make sure I was getting back the correct data and familiar with the data.
* I then created my React app using the React template generator
* I then tested the api endpoints to ensure I was fetching the correct data once again in my Asteroids component, to tick off task 1.
* Deciding what data to display to the user
